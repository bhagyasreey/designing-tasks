I used Adobe Express software to do all the three posters.
The first poster was the trickiest one for me as I wasn't able to decide on the background image.
The second and third posters were pretty easy to do. 
I decided to keep the ganesh chathurthi poster simple and yet attractive by using complimentary colors.
And the ethereal background for the Amma's poster gives off the spiritual feel.
